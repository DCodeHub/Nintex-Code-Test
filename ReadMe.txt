1. I have created a APi which can be hosted in IIS. My free azure account has exprired. I am unable to subscribe.
2. Created a simple local SQL dtabase with 2 tables.
3. Created a three controller API for default operations.
4. The required operations can also be applied with stored procedures created.
5. The API Can be tested and by the Swagger. To view that http://localhost:50298/swagger.

This will display all the required operations. The input and output can be viewed with comments there.
If i have added the controllres from MVC as well. 
Please use any one of the options to consume the API.
